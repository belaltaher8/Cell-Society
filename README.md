CompSci 308 Cell Society Project

#####Team Member Names: Jay Doherty, Tahia Emran and Belal Taher 

#####Date Started: January 28, 2017

#####Date Finished: February 12, 2017

#####Estimated Number of Hours Worked: 

#####Each Person's Role in Developing the Project:
###### Jay:
	I did the XML reading for this project. I implemented the XMLReader and ConfigDoc classes that allows us to modify the simulation parameters on the fly.
	I helped with the front-end GUIController class to make it properly handle exceptions and interact with the xml parser.
	I also implemented the Cell class and it's hierarchy, some of the Simulation class and it's hierarchy, and worked with Belal on the individual simulations.

###### Tahia:
	I worked mostly on the front-end of the project (the Visualization part), developing all of the display classes and the GUIController. 
	I also helped with planning how we would handle extra simulations and extensions, as well as how the back and front ends interact. 
	
###### Belal:
	I worked mostly on the grid class and helped with the abstraction for the hierarchies we used. I also worked on cell intelligence for two of the simulations (one of which we weren't able to finish and include in the final project). I also partially worked on the simulation class.

##### Books, Papers and Online Resources Used in Developing the Project: 
	JavaDocs for JavaFX Charts, BorderPane, HBox, and Polygon classes
	Stack Overflow for random number generation
	
##### Files Used to Start the Project
	Main.java 

##### Files Used to Test the Project 
	fire_spreading.xml, game_of_life.xml, predator_prey.xml, segregation.xml, snapshot.xml 
	
##### Data/ Resource Files Required by the Project
	fire_spreading.xml, game_of_life.xml, predator_prey.xml, segregation.xml, FireSpreadSim.properties, GameofLifeSim.properties, GUI.properties, PredatorPreySim.properties, SegregationSim.properties
	
##### Any Information about Using the Program 
	Just run main and choose one of the xml files to get started.

##### Any Extra Features Included in the Project
	N/A

##### Impressions of the Assignment and How to Improve it in the Future
	This assignment was challenging, but a do-able team project. In the future, it could be improved if the second sprint wasn't significantly more work to complete in a shorter amount of time (aka giving us at least as much time to complete the second sprint as the first).
