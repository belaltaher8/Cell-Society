# CellSociety

## Description
Cell Society is a 2D grid used to simulate cellular automata. Cellular Automata, CA, are simulations based on a model that consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states (such as on and off). Simulations start with all cells in an initial state and are run by updating each cell based on a set of fixed rules described in terms of the cell's current state and the states of its immediate neighbors. Though this model is simply described, it can be used to simulate a wide variety of complex phenomena, such as ant foraging to economic theory to the whole universe.
