###### Jay:

###### Tahia:
	I worked mostly on the front-end of the project (the Visualization part), developing all of the display classes and the GUIController. 
	I also helped with planning how we would handle extra simulations and extensions, as well as how the back and front ends interact. 
	
###### Belal:

##### Books, Papers and Online Resources Used in Developing the Project: 
	JavaDocs for JavaFX Charts, BorderPane, HBox, and Polygon classes
	Stack Overflow for random number generation
	
##### Files Used to Start the Project
	Main.java 

##### Files Used to Test the Project 
	fire_spreading.xml, game_of_life.xml, predator_prey.xml, segregation.xml, snapshot.xml 
	
##### Data/ Resource Files Required by the Project
	fire_spreading.xml, game_of_life.xml, predator_prey.xml, segregation.xml, FireSpreadSim.properties, GameofLifeSim.properties, GUI.properties, PredatorPreySim.properties, SegregationSim.properties
	
##### Any Information about Using the Program 
	All the simulations are super cool to watch and play with with the controls. 

##### Any Extra Features Included in the Project
	N/A

##### Impressions of the Assignment and How to Improve it in the Future
	This assignment was challenging, but a do-able team project. In the future, it could be improved if the second sprint wasn't significantly more work to complete in a shorter amount of time (aka giving us at least as much time to complete the second sprint as the first).
